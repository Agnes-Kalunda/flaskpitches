            <p>Introducing yourself well sets the stage for a professional conversation, whether that’s at a networking event, with a colleague or at the beginning of an interview. One tool many people use to make introductions simple and effective is the elevator pitch. </p>

                <div class="panel-heading">The Perfect Pitch</div>
                <div class="panel-body">Condensing 50+ years of of your life accomplishments into a 30-second statement that packs a punch can feel as challenging as trying to stuff an elephant into a Volkswagen Beetle. I get that. So to help you develop a knockout pitch, I've broken the process into nine steps:<p></p>
                   
                     <strong>Read your pitch out loud.</strong> As Fast Company’s Deborah Grayson Riegel recently pointed out in her article "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3004484/problem-your-elevator-pitch-and-how-fix-it">The Problem With Your Elevator Pitch and How to Fix it</a>", writing is more formal and structured than speaking. If you’re not careful, your pitch can come off sounding more like an infomercial than a conversation.<p>Reading it aloud then tinkering with the words will help you sound more authentic.</p>
                    <p></p>
                     <strong>Practice, practice, practice (then solicit feedback)</strong>Rehearse your pitch in front of a mirror or use the recording capabilities of your computer, so you can see and hear how you sound.<p>This might feel awkward at first, but the more you practice, the smoother your delivery will be.</p> <p>Keep tweaking your pitch until it no longer sounds rehearsed. When your presentation is polished to your satisfaction, try it out on a few friends and ask them what they thought your key points were. If their response doesn’t square with your objective, the speech still needs work.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Prepare a few variations.</b>You might want to say things slightly differently to an interviewer than to a former colleague. Also, sometimes you'll just have 15 seconds for a pitch (kind of a short elevator ride), other times you may have a minute or two. <p>So focus on mastering a few key talking points then work up ways to customize your speech for particular situations.</p>Use the word count feature on your computer to create shorter and longer pitches; a good rule of thumb is that you can say about 150 words in one minute.<p></p>
                    <p></p>
                 <b>Nail it with confidence.</b> The best-worded pitch in the world will fall flat unless it’s conveyed well.<p>When you give the speech, look the person in the eye, smile and deliver your message with a confident, upbeat delivery.</p>
